## 📻 Radio Station List

The list of radio stations is stored in a text file: **station_list.txt**

The file must be placed in the **root directory of the SD card**.

### Priority and Storage Options

- The station list can also be **stored permanently inside the firmware code** and used without an SD card.
- If an SD card is inserted and the file **station_list.txt** exists, the device will **load the station list from the SD card first**.
- If the file is not found, the internal station list compiled in the firmware will be used.

### File format

Example:

Radio 01 Name, http://radio-stream-link-01

Radio 02 Name, http://radio-stream-link-02


- One station per line  
- Station name and stream URL separated by a comma

## 📶 Wi-Fi

- The device can store **up to 5 Wi-Fi networks** in memory.
- If memory is full when attempting to save another network, the device will display the list of saved networks so one can be selected for replacement.

### Connection Priority Logic

1. The device first attempts to connect to the **last used network**.
2. If the connection fails, it scans for available networks already stored in memory.
3. If multiple known networks are found, the device connects to the **strongest signal**.
4. If no known networks are available, the device displays the list of currently available networks for selection.

- Wi-Fi settings are automatically saved to memory.

### Reset Wi-Fi settings

To reset stored Wi-Fi credentials:

1. Start the program  
2. Press **BtnG0** while the device is attempting to connect to the network
