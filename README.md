## 🔥 Flashing / Installation

This firmware **must be flashed using the provided `.bin` file**.

### ✅ Recommended method (WORKING)
Use a dedicated ESP32 flashing tool or launcher that flashes the binary **without modifying the partition table**.

#### Steps:
1. Download the `.bin` file from the **Releases** section.
2. Connect the M5Stack Cardputer via USB.
3. Flash the firmware using:
   - launcher
   - esptool
   - or any tool that supports direct `.bin` flashing
4. After flashing, reboot the device.

This method is required because the firmware uses a **custom partition scheme (Huge APP)**.

### ❌ M5Burner (NOT SUPPORTED)
Flashing this firmware using **M5Burner is NOT supported**.

M5Burner may overwrite the partition table or use a default layout that is incompatible with this project, which can result in:
- the application not starting
- boot loops
- black screen or crashes

Please use the recommended flashing method above.

## 📻 Radio Station List

The list of radio stations is stored in a text file: **station_list.txt**

The file must be placed in the **root directory of the SD card**.

### File format:

Example:
Radio 01 Name, http://radio-stream-link-01  
Radio 02 Name, http://radio-stream-link-02


- one station per line  
- station name and stream URL separated by a comma
